# trustybot-music

Goal: To make a music bot with works entirely without chat input (slash) commands

(still haven't thought of a way to rid of the /start_session command)

Subgoals:
- more queue controls like:
  - delete tracks in specific range
  - add tracks at index
  - reverse queue
  - move tracks to new index
- actually implementing button permissions
