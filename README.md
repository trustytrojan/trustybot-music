# trustybot-music

don't mind the name it's based off my first bot named "trustybot"
(i'm not very creative)

## Goal
To make a music bot with works entirely without chat input (slash) commands

(still haven't thought of a way to rid of the /start_session command)

## Subgoals
- more queue controls like:
  - delete tracks in specific range
  - add tracks at index
  - reverse queue
  - move tracks to new index
- actually implementing button-role permissions
